            <h3 class="left">Immigration can be a stressful experience for seniors. They often have to cope with isolation, language constraints, and income stress. Thus, senior immigrants often turn to technology to adapt to their new society and maintain contact with their community from home. However, there are many barriers that can prevent seniors from using technology, which can have harmful consequences on their well-being.</h3>

            <h2 class="left">GATHERING DATA</h2>
            <h3 class="left">After determining our problem space and target audience, our next step was to gather data regarding our demographic’s attitudes and opinions towards using technology in their daily lives. Each group member selected an individual to interview for a total of three interviews. Using a prewritten script, we asked open-ended questions allowing the user to give free responses that provided varied and detailed information. All interviews were recorded and transcribed for data analysis</h3>
            <h3 class="left yellowtext">Research Goals</h3>
            <h3 class="experience tab">1. We want to understand how seniors interact with technology in their everyday lives. </h3>
            <h3 class="experience tab">2. We want to know what points of confusion seniors face when interacting with technology. </h3>
            <h3 class="experience tab">3. We want to understand factors that prevent seniors from learning technology.</h3>
            <h2>DATA ANALYSIS</h2>
            <h3 class="left">After collecting and reviewing all of the data from our interviews, we analyzed the data using affinity diagramming. Our first step was to generate an “idea dump” in a rapid-fire brainstorming session. Team members pulled from notes they had independently generated before the exercise as well as new connections or ideas they found during the group brainstorming. We then organized our notes into categories.</h3>

            <h3 class="experience tab">1. <b>Tablets</b> are often the device of choice among the senior population.</h3>
            <h3 class="experience tab">2. Seniors often <b>depend on family and friends</b> to initially teach them about technology.</h3>
            <h3 class="experience tab">3. Seniors also <b>rely on Google</b> to answer specific questions once they have passed the learning curve.</h3>
            <h3 class="experience tab">4. Seniors mainly use technology for <b>social purposes</b>, <b>leisure</b>, and <b>managing health</b>.</h3>
            <h3 class="experience tab">5. <b>Social activities</b> seem to be the most common tasks.</h3>
            <h3 class="experience tab">6. Often times, seniors <b>do not see the benefit</b> of learning many new technologies or features.</h3>
            <h3 class="experience tab">7. While immigrant seniors generally acknowledge that technology enables communication with friends and family abroad, many tend to find the use of technology an <b>overall isolating experience</b>.</h3>

            <h3 class="left">We decided to pursue this design over the others as we felt it best addressed the expressed needs and desires of our demographic.</h3>

            <h2 class="left">THINK ALOUD WALKTHROUGH</h2>
            <h3 class="left">We used the think aloud protocol to conduct usability tests on our initial prototype. We recruited participants both in our core demographic, immigrant seniors aged 65+, and secondary users who might use this app. These secondary users consisted of those who might use this app to help a family member or friend with technological issues.</h3>
            <h3 class="left yellowtext">Research Goals</h3>
            <h3 class="experience tab">1. Determine the intuitiveness of the initial design.</h3>
            <h3 class="experience tab">2. Locate the users' points of confusion.</h3>
            <h3 class="experience tab">3. Compile a list of suggested features.</h3>
            <h3 class="experience tab">3. Determine the app's perceived usefulness by users.</h3>
            <h3 class="left">Our interviews were conducted via Zoom calls and recorded for review. The interviewer used screen sharing to show the prototype screens to the interviewee, who was in turn asked to talk aloud as they went through the steps of a prewritten procedure script that we had prepared. The interviewer script/procedure plan is outlined here:</h3>
            <h3 class="left yellowtext">Procedure Plan</h3>
            <h3 class="experience tab">1. Ask the participant to complete a scenario (i.e. “Demonstrate how you would use the this app to share your screen with a friend.”).</h3>
            <h3 class="experience tab">2. Ask the user to do a screen-by-screen evaluation, expressing any thoughts that arise regarding purpose; expected functionality; or general likes, dislikes, or areas of confusion.</h3>
            <h3 class="experience tab">3. Determine the user’s perceived usefulness of the app.</h3>
            <h3 class="experience tab">3. Record any suggestions for add-ons or improvements.</h3>
            <h3 class="left yellowtext">Key Insights</h3>
            <h3 class="left"><b>Issue 1:</b> The UI needs to focus on simplicity rather than feature overload.</h3>
            <h3 class="left"><b>Solution:</b> Focus design around only those features which are most necessary.</h3>
            <br>
            <h3 class="left"><b>Issue 2:</b> Elderly users would like to use this app to gain technological independence rather than soley rely on help.</h3>
            <h3 class="left"><b>Solution:</b> Include a recording option so that users can review old sessions.</h3>
            <br>
            <h3 class="left"><b>Issue 3:</b> Some users may have privacy concerns regarding relinquishing control of their devices to another.</h3>
            <h3 class="left"><b>Solution:</b> Include a chat-only option so that users do not have to give full control of their device.</h3>
            <br>
            <h3 class="left"><b>Issue 4:</b> Users find the contacts page confusing.</h3>
            <h3 class="left"><b>Solution:</b> Adjust the contacts page to include contact options from your phonebook and other apps.</h3>

                <h3 class="left">
                    This final design addresses all of the key insights from our evaluations. We have fleshed out the design while keeping a focus on basic features, added in a recording and video library option, created a voice-only help session choice, and updated the contact page to pull from existing contact lists. We place a focus on WhatsApp here as this tends to be a top messaging service for immigrant seniors specifically.
                </h3>
                <h3 class="left">
                    Our next step in this process would be to conduct further usability tests and continue to revise this app. We would continue the process of iteration we followed to reach this final solution.
